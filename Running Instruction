step 1: generate scenarios
Generate_Scenario_text_image_video: Scenario generation for a given problem size
Step 2: Redo classification based on AI generated scenarios
combined_cgpt_classify_image_all: perform image classifcation using GPT
combined_cgpt_classify_text_all: perform text classification using GPT
combined_gemini_classify_text_all: perform text classification using gemini
combined_gemini_classify_image_all: perform image classification using gemini
combined_gemini_classify_video_all: perform video classification using gemini
Step 3: Generate confusion matrix and other analysis (Analysis folder)

Due to the large size of images and videos and the space limitation in github, we keep 1 generated image and video samples for each problem size for a demonstration on github.
The summary statistics of total 150 scenarios are saved in the csv files which can be used by the python files in the analysis folder to perform further analyis.
